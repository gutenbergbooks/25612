<p class="centern"><b><i>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes</i></b></p>

<p><b>About this book.</b> <i>The Art or crafte of Rhetoryke</i>, by Leonard Cox (or
Cockes) was originally published c. 1530; the second edition was
published in 1532. It is considered the first book on rhetoric written
in the English language.</p>

<p><b>Typography.</b> This e-book was transcribed from the 1532 edition. The
original line and paragraph breaks, hyphenation, spelling,
capitalization, and punctuation, including the use of a spaced forward
slash (/) for the comma, the use of u for v and vice versa, and the
use of i for j, have been preserved. All apparent printer errors have
also been preserved, and are hyperlinked to a <a href="#Printer_Errors">list</a> at the end of this
document.</p>

<p>The following alterations have been made:</p>

<p>1. Long-s (&#383;) has been regularized as s.</p>

<p>2. The paragraph symbol, resembling a C in the original, is rendered
as &#182;.</p>

<p>3. Missing hyphens have been added in brackets, e.g. [-].</p>

<p>4. Abbreviations and contractions represented as special characters in
the original have been expanded as noted in the table below. A
macron means a horizontal line over a letter. A cursive semicolon
is an old-style semicolon somewhat resembling a handwritten z.
Supralinear means directly over a letter. Superscript means raised
and next to a letter. The y referred to below is an Early Modern
English form of the Anglo-Saxon thorn character, representing th,
but identical in appearance to the letter y.</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="expansions">
<tr><td class="center"><b>Original</b></td><td class="center"><b>Expansion</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;c with macron</td><td>&amp;c[etera]</td></tr>
<tr><td>q with cursive semicolon</td><td>q[ue]</td></tr>
<tr><td>superscript closed curve</td><td>[us]</td></tr>
<tr><td>long final s</td><td>[e]s</td></tr>
<tr><td>crossed p</td><td>p[er] or p[ar]</td></tr>
<tr><td>p with looped downstroke</td><td>p[ro]</td></tr>
<tr><td>p with macron</td><td>p[re]</td></tr>
<tr><td>consonant with supralinear upward curve</td><td>consonant[er]</td></tr>
<tr><td>w with supralinear t</td><td>w[i]t[h]</td></tr>
<tr><td>y with macron</td><td>y[at] (i.e., that)</td></tr>
<tr><td>y with supralinear u</td><td>y[o]u (i.e., thou)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Superscript letters are rendered as they appear in the original, e.g.,
y<span class="sup">e</span> = the; y<span class="sup">t</span> = that.</p>

<p>A macron over a vowel represents m or n, and is rendered as it appears
in the original, e.g., c&#333;preh&#275;ded = comprehended.</p>

<p><b>Greek.</b> This text contains some phrases in ancient Greek. Hover the
mouse over the Greek to see a pop-up transliteration, like this:
<span lang="el" title="Greek: biblos">&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>.</p>

<p><b>Pagination.</b> This book was printed as an octavo volume, and was
paginated using a recto-verso scheme. In octavo printing, the printer
uses large sheets of paper folded and cut into eight leaves each,
creating 16 pages. The front of each leaf is the recto page (the
right-hand page in a book); the back of each leaf is the verso page
(the left-hand page in a book). For this book, the printer apparently
used six sheets, lettered A through F, and each leaf is numbered with
a lower-case Roman numeral, i through viii. Thus, for example, the
first leaf (i) from the second sheet (B) is numbered B.i.</p>

<p>In the original, page numbers are printed only on the recto side of
each leaf, and are not printed at all after the fourth or fifth recto
page of each sheet, until the first leaf of the next sheet. For the
reader&#8217;s convenience, all pages in this e-book, even those without a
printed number in the original, have been numbered according to the
original format, with the addition of &#8220;r&#8221; for recto and &#8220;v&#8221; for verso.
Pages A.i.v and F.viii.r are blank and are not numbered in this
e-book.</p>

<p><b>Sources consulted.</b> This e-book was prepared from microfiche scans of
the 1532 edition, which can be viewed at the Biblioth√®que nationale de
France (BnF/Gallica) website at http://gallica.bnf.fr. The uneven
quality of the scans, and the blackletter font in the original, made
the scans difficult to read in some places. To ensure accuracy, the
transcriber has consulted the following sources:</p>

he must haue wyt to deserne &amp; iuge whe-<br />

his mynde be conuenient to the purpose<br />
or nat. For oft&#275;tymes yf a man lacke this<br />
property / he may aswell tell that that is<br />
against hym as with hym / as experience<br />
doth dayly shew. &para; The thyrde is Dispo-<br />
sicion / wherby he may know how to order<br />

ted (as the comon prouerbe sayth) to put<br />
the carte afore the horse. &para; The fourth<br />
&amp; last is suche thynges as he hath inuen-<br />
ted: and by Iugement knowen apte to his<br />
purpose whan they are set in theyr order<br />
so to speke them that it may be pleasaunt<br />
and delectable to the audience / so that it<br />
may be sayd of hym that hystories make<br />

<p>
<span class="dropcap">I</span>N olde tyme there was greate enuy<br />
betwene two noble men of Rome / of<br />
wh&#333; the one was called Milo / &amp; the other<br />
Clodius / which malice grew so ferre that<br />
Clodius layd wayte for Milo on a season<br />
whan he sholde ryde out of the Citie / and<br />
in his iourney set vpon hym / and there as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[A.v.r]</a></span><br />
it chaunced: Clodius was slayne / where<br />
vpon this Clodius frendes accused Milo<br />
to the Cenate of murder. Tully whiche in<br />
tho days was a great Aduocate in Rome<br />
sholde plede Miloes cause. Now it was<br />
open that Milo had slayne Clodius / but<br />
whether he had slayn hym laufully or nat<br />
was the doubte. So than the Theme of<br />
Tullies oraci&#333; or plee for Milo was this /<br />
that he had slayne Clodius laufully / and<br />
therfore he ought nat to be punisshed / for<br />
the confirmacion wherof (as dothe appere<br />
in Tullies oracion) he dyd brynge out of<br />
places of Rhetoryque argumentes to p[ro]ue<br />
his sayd Theme or purpose. And likewyse<br />
must we do whan we haue any mater to<br />
speke or comun of. As if I sholde make an<br />
oracion to the laude &amp; prayse of the Kyn-<br />
ges highnes: I must for the Inuencyon<br />
of suche thynges as be for my purpose go<br />
to places of Rhetorique / where I shall<br />
easely finde (after I know the rules) that<br />
that I desyre. &para; Here is to be noted that<br />
there is no Theme but it is conteyned vn[-]<br />
der one of the foure causes / or for the more<br />
playnnes foure kyndes of Oracions.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; The fyrste is called Logycall / whyche<br />
kinde we call properly disputaci&#333;. &para; The<br />
seconde is called Demonstratiue. &para; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[A.v.v]</a></span><br />
thyrde Deliberatiue. &para; The fourth Iudi-<br />
ciall / and these thre last be properly called<br />
spices or kyndes of oracions / whose natu-<br />
res shall be declared seperately hereafter<br />
with the crafte that is required in euery of<br />
them. All themes that perteine to Logike<br />
either they be simple or compounde. As yf<br />
a man desyre to know of me what Iustice<br />
is. This onely th&#299;g Iustice is my theme.<br />
Or if disputacion be had in company vpon<br />
religion / and I wolde declare the very na-<br />
ture of religion / my theme shulde be this<br />
simple or one thynge religion. But yf it be<br />
doubted whether Iustyce be a vertue or<br />
nat / and I wolde proue the parte affyrma[-]<br />
tyue / my theme were now compo&#363;de / that<br />
is to say / Iustice is a vertue / for it is made<br />
of two thynges knyt and vnied togither /<br />
Iustice and vertue. &para; Here must be noted<br />
that Logike is a playn &amp; a sure way to in-<br />
struct a m&#257; of the trouth of euery thynge /<br />
&amp; that in it the natures / causes / partes / &amp;<br />
effectes of thynges are by certayne rules<br />
discussed &amp; serched out / so that nothing can<br />
be p[er]fectly &amp; p[ro]perly know&#275; but by rules of<br />
Logike / which is nothing but an obserua[-]<br />
cyon / or a dylygent markynge of nature.<br />
whereby in euery thynge mannes reason<br />
dothe consyder what is fyrste / what last /<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[A.vi.r]</a></span><br />
what proper / what improper.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; The places or instrumentes of a simple<br />
theme are.<br />
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The diffinicion of the thynge.<br />
The causes.<br />
The partes.<br />
The effectes.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Ex&#257;ple. If thou inquire what th&#299;g Iu[-]<br />
stice is / whereof it cometh / what partes it<br />
hath / &amp; what is the office or effect of euery<br />
parte / than hast thou dilig&#275;tly serched out<br />
the hole nature of Iustice / &amp; handeled thy<br />
simple theme accordyng to the precept[e]s of<br />
Logicians / to whom our auctour leueth<br />
suche mat[er]s to be discussed of th&#275; / how beit<br />
somwhat y<span class="sup">e</span> Rhetorici&#257;s haue to do with<br />
y<span class="sup">e</span> simple theme / &amp; asmoche as shall be for<br />
theyr entent he wyll shew hereafter. For<br />
many tymes the oratour must vse bothe<br />
diffinicions &amp; diuisions. But as they be in<br />
Logike playne and compendiouse / so are<br />
they in Rhetorike ext&#275;ded &amp; paynted with<br />
many figures &amp; ornament[e]s belongyng to<br />
the science. Neuertheles to satisfie the re-<br />
ders mynde / &amp; to alleuiate the tediousnes<br />
of serchynge these places / I wyll open the<br />
maner and facion of the handelyng of the<br />
theme aforsayd as playnly as I can / after<br />
the preceptes of Logike.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[A.vi.v]</a></span></p>

<p>
&para; First to serche out the perfite knowlege<br />
of Iustice: I go to my fyrst place diffinici[-]<br />
on / &amp; fetche from Aristotle in his Ethik[e]s<br />
the Diffinicion of Iustice / which is this.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Iustice is a morall vertue / wherby men<br />
be the werkers of rightfull thynges (that<br />
is to saye) whereby they bothe loue &amp; also<br />
do suche thynges as be iust. This done: I<br />
serche the causes of Iustice (that is to say)<br />
from whens it toke the fyrst begynnyng /<br />
and by cause that it is a morall vertue: and<br />
Plato in the ende of his Dialogue Men&#333;<br />
concludeth that all vertue cometh of god:<br />
I am assured that god is the chief cause of<br />
Iustice: declaryng it to the worlde by his<br />
Instrument m&#257;nes wyt / whiche the same<br />
Plato affyrmeth in the begynnyng of his<br />
lawes. The Diffinicion and cause had: I<br />
come to the thyrde place called partes to<br />
knowe whether there be but one kynde of<br />
Iustice or els many. And for this purpose<br />
I fynde that Arystotle in the fyfte of his<br />
Ethikes deuideth Iustice in two speces or<br />
kyndes. One y<span class="sup">t</span> he calleth Iustice legiti-<br />
me or legal / an other that he called Equi-<br />
te. &para; Iustice legall is that that consysteth<br />
in the superiours whiche haue power for<br />
to make or statute lawes to the &#299;feriours.<br />
And the office or ende of this Iustice is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[A.vii.r]</a></span><br />
make suche lawes as be bothe good and<br />
accordynge to right and conscience / &amp; th&#257;<br />
to declare them / &amp; whan they are made &amp;<br />
publisshed as they ought to be / to se that<br />
they be put in vre / for what auaileth it to<br />
make neuer so good lawes: yf they be nat<br />
obserued and kept. &para; And finally that the<br />
maker of the lawe applye his hole studie &amp;<br />
mynde to the welthe of his subiectes and<br />
to the comon profyte of them. The other<br />
kynde of Iustice whiche men call Equitie<br />
is whereby a man neyther taketh nor gy-<br />
ueth lesse nor more than he ought / but in<br />
gyuynge taketh good hede that euery m&#257;<br />
haue accordynge as he deserueth. This<br />
Equitie is agayne deuyded into Equitie<br />
distributyue of comon thynges &amp; Equitie<br />
Commutatiue. By Equitie distributyue<br />
is distributyd and giuen of comon goodes<br />
to euery m&#257; accordyng to his deseruyng[e]s<br />
and as he is worthy to haue. As to deuide<br />
amonge suche as longe to the Chyrche of<br />
the Chyrche goodes after the qualitie of<br />
theyr merytes: and to them beynge Ciuil<br />
persones of the comon treasour of the Ci-<br />
tie accordynge as they are worthy.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; In this parte is comprehended the pu-<br />
nyshment of mysdoers and trangressours<br />
of the lawe / to whome correccion must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[A.vii.v]</a></span><br />
distributed for the comon welth according<br />
to theyr demerites / after the prescripcions<br />
of the lawes of the contrey / made &amp; deter-<br />
mined for the punisshment of any maner<br />
of transgressour. &para; Equity c&#333;mutatiue is<br />
a iust maner in the chaungynge of thyng[e]s<br />
from one to another / whose offyce or effect<br />
is to kepe iust dealynge in equytie / as by-<br />

stice declared theyr offices / which was the<br />
fourth &amp; last place.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Our auctour also in a great worke that<br />
he hath made vpon Rhetorike / declareth<br />
the handelynge of a theme symple by the<br />
same example of Iustice / addynge two pla[-]<br />
ces mo / whiche are called affines and con-<br />
traries on this maner.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; What is Iustice? A vertue whereby to<br />
euery thynge is gyuen that that to it be-<br />
longeth.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; What is the cause thereof? Mannes<br />
wyll consentynge with lawes &amp; maners.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; How many kyndes? Two.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Whiche? Commutatiue &amp; Distributiue /<br />
for in two maners is our medlynge with<br />
other men / eyther in thynges of our sub-<br />
staunce &amp; wares / or in gentyll and cyuyle<br />
conuersacion.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[A.viii.r]</a></span></p>

<p>
&para; what thynge is Iustice commutatiue?<br />
Right and equitie in all contractes.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; what is Iustice distributiue? Iustice of<br />
ciuile lyuynge.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; How manyfolde is Iustyce dystrybu-<br />
tyue? Either it is comon or priuate. The<br />
comon is called in latin Pietas / but in en-<br />
glysshe it may be moost properly named<br />
good order / which is the crowne of all ver[-]<br />
tues <a href="#Printer_Errors">conceruynge</a> honest and ciuile con-<br />
uersacyon of men togither / as the hedes<br />
with the meane comonalty in good vnity<br />
and concorde. &para; Pryuate or seuerall Iu-<br />
stice dystrybutyue is honest and amyable<br />
frendeshyp &amp; conuersacion of neighbours.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; What are the offyces? To do for euery<br />
man / ryche or pore / of what estate so euer<br />
he be / and for our contrey / for our wyues /<br />
chyldren / and frendes / that that ought to<br />
be done for euery of them.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Affynes or vertues nigh to Iustice are<br />
constancy / lyberalytie / temperaunce.<br />
</p>

<p>
Thynges contrary are fere / couetyse / pro-<br />
dygalytie.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; And this is the maner of handelynge<br />
of a symple Theme dialectycall. But yet<br />
let nat the reder deceyue hym selfe / and<br />
thynke that the very perfyte knowlege is<br />

Uery Theme compounde: ey-<br />

Now whether thou wylt p[ro]ue<br />
or improue any thyng: it must<br />
be done by argument. And yf<br />
any Theme compounde: be it Logicall or<br />
Rhetorycall / it must be referred to the<br />
rules of Logike by th&#275; to be proued trew<br />
or fals. For this is the dyfference that is<br />
betwene these two sciences / that the Lo-<br />

solicitous that there be spok&#275; no more nor<br />

pleasaunt figures and to delate the mater<br />
belongeth to the Rhetorician. As in Mi-<br />
loes cause / of whome was made mencion<br />
afore. &para; A logician wolde briefly argue /<br />
who so euer violently wyll slee an other /<br />
may lawfully of the other be slayne in his<br />
defence. Clodius wolde vyolently haue<br />
slain Milo / wherfore Clodius might lau-<br />
fully be slayne of Milo in Miloes owne<br />
defence. And this argument the logicians<br />
call a Sillogisme in Darii / whiche Tully<br />
in his oracion extendeth that in foure or<br />
fyue leues it is scant made an ende of / nor<br />
no man can haue knowlege whether Tul-<br />
lies argument that he maketh in his ora-<br />

<span class="dropcaplg">T</span>He vse of an oracion demon-<br />

Demosthenes / and also many of Thucidi-<br />

of oracions demonstratiue.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; The fyrst conteyneth the prayse or dys-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[B.ii.r]</a></span><br />
prayse of persones. As yf a man wolde<br />
prayse the kynges hyghnes / or dysprayse<br />
some yll persone / it must be done by an ora[-]<br />

an oracion demonstratiue is: where in is<br />
praysed or dyspraysed / nat the persone but<br />
the dede. As if a thefe put hym selfe in ieo-<br />
p[ar]dy for the safegarde of a true m&#257; / against<br />
other theues and murderers / the p[er]son can<br />
nat be praysed for his vicious lyuyng / but<br />
yet the dede is worthy to be commended.<br />
Or if one shulde speake of Peters denyeng<br />
of Christ / he hath nothyng to disprayse y<span class="sup">e</span><br />

kynde is: wherin is lauded or blamed no-<br />

<p class="center">&para; Partes of an Oracion.</p>

<p>
&para; The partes of an oracion prescribed of<br />
Rhetoriciens are these.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; The Preamble or exorden.<br />
&para; The tale or narracion.<br />
&para; The prouynge of the matter or conten-<br />

<p>
&para; Of the whiche partes mencyon shall be<br />
made herafter in euery kynde of oracions /<br />
for they are nat founde generally in euery<br />
oracion / but some haue moo partes / and<br />
some lesse.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">&para; Of the Preamble.</p>

<p>
<span class="dropcaplg">G</span>Enerally the Preamble nat alonly<br />
in an oracion demonstratiue / but al-<br />
so in the other two is conteyned and<br />
must be fetched out of thre places / that is<br />
to say of beneuolence / attencion / &amp; to make<br />
the mater easy to be knowen / whiche the<br />
Rhetoricians call Docilite.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Beneuolence is the place whereby the<br />
herer is made willyng to here vs / and it is<br />
conteyned in the thynge that we speke of /<br />
in them whom we speke to / &amp; in our owne<br />
persone. The easyest and moost vsed place<br />
of beneuolence consysteth in the offyce or<br />
duety of the person / whan we shew that it<br />
is our duety to do that we be about.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Out of this place is fet y<span class="sup">e</span> p[re]&#257;ble of sa&#299;t<br />
Gregory Nazazene / made to the praise of<br />
saynt Basyll / where he saith that it is his<br />
<a href="#Printer_Errors">his</a> duety to prayse saynt Basyll for thre<br />
causes. For the great loue and frendeshyp<br />
that hath ben always betwene them / and<br />
agayne for the remembra&#363;ce of the moost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[B.iii.r]</a></span><br />
fayre and excellent vertues that were in<br />
hym / and thyrdely that the chyrch myght<br />
haue an example of a good and holy Bys-<br />
shop. &para; Trewly by our authours lycence<br />
me thynketh that in the preamble Naza-<br />
zen doth nat only take beneuolence out of<br />
the place of his owne persone / but also out<br />
of the other two / wh&#257; he sheweth the cause<br />
of his duetye / for in praysynge his frende<br />
he dyd but his duetye. In praysynge his<br />
vertues / he cam to the place of beneuol&#275;ce<br />
of hym that he spake of / as touchyng the<br />
example that the chyrche shulde haue / it<br />
was for theyr profite / and concernyng the<br />
place of beneuolence / taken of them that<br />
he spake to. But our authour regarded<br />
chiefly the principall proposicion / whiche<br />
was that saynt Gregory Nazazene was<br />
bounde to praise saint Basyll.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; A lyke example of beneuolence taken<br />
out of the place of office or dutie / is in the<br />
oracyon that Tully made for the Poete<br />
Archias / whiche begynneth thus.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="dropcap">M</span>Y lordes that be here iuges / yf there<br />
be in me any wyt / whiche I knowe<br />
is but small / or yf I haue any crafty vse of<br />

or yf any helpe to that science cometh out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[B.iii.v]</a></span><br />
of other lyberall artes / in whome I haue<br />
occupied al my lyfe / surely I am bo&#363;de to<br />
no man more for them than to Archias /<br />
whiche may lawfully if I may do any m&#257;<br />
any profite by them / chalenge a chiefe por[-]<br />
cion for hym therin.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Out of this place dyd this same Tully<br />
fetche the begynnyng of his fyrste epistle /<br />
in whome he wrytethe to one Lentule on<br />
this maner: I do so my deutie in al poyn-<br />
tes towarde you / and so great is the loue<br />
and reuerence that I bere vnto you that<br />
all other men say that I can do no more /<br />
and yet me semeth that I haue neuer don<br />
that that I am bounde to do / eyther to<br />
you or in your cause.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; We may also get beneuolence by reason<br />
of them / whome we make our oracion of:<br />
As yf we saye that we can neuer prayse<br />
hym to hyghly / but y<span class="sup">t</span> he is worthy moch<br />
more laude and prayse. And so taketh sa&#299;t<br />
Nazianzene beneuolence in his sayd ora-<br />
cion for sainct Basile.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Also of them afore whome we speke / as<br />
if we say / it is for theyr profyte to laude or<br />
prayse the p[er]son. And that we knowe very<br />
wel howe moche they haue alwayes loued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[B.iiii.r]</a></span><br />
hym / and that he ought therfore to be prai[-]<br />
sed the more for theyr sakes. The maner<br />
is also to get vs beneuolence in the preface<br />
of our oracion / by pynchyng and blamyng<br />
of our aduersarie. As doth Tullie in the o-<br />
racion that he made for one Aulus Cecin-<br />
na / wherin he begynneth his proeme thus<br />
If temerite and lake of shame coulde as<br />
moche preuayle in plees afore the iustices /<br />
as doth audacite and temerarious bolde-<br />
nesse in the feldes and deserte places / there<br />
were no remedie but euen so muste Aulus<br />
Cecinna be ouercome in this matter by<br />
Sextus Ebucius impudence / as he was<br />
in the felde ouercome by his insidious au-<br />
dacite. And these be the c&#333;mune formes of<br />
beneuolence.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; A man may also fetche his proeme out<br />
of the nature of the place wher he speketh /<br />
as Tullie dothe in the oracion made for<br />
Pompeius for the sendynge of hym into<br />
Asie agaynst kynge Mithridates of Pon-<br />
tus / and kynge <a href="#Printer_Errors">Tigraues</a> of Armenie on<br />
this maner: howe be it my lordes and mai[-]<br />
sters of this noble citie of Rome / I haue al<br />
tymes thought it a synguler reioyse to me<br />
if I myght ones se you gadred to gyther<br />
in a c&#333;pany / to here some publique oracion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[B.iiii.v]</a></span><br />
of myne / and agayne I iuged no place to<br />
be so ample and so honourable to speke in<br />
as this is. &amp;c[etera].<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Or he may begyn at the nature of the<br />
tyme that is than / or at som other cyrcum[-]<br />
staunce of his mater / as Tully taketh the<br />
begynnynge of his oracion for Celius at<br />
the tyme / this wise.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; If so be it my lordes iuges any m&#257; be<br />
now present here that is ignor&#257;t of your<br />
lawes / of your processe in iugement[e]s / and<br />
of your customes / surely he may well mar[-]<br />
uell what so heynous a mater this shulde<br />
be / that it onely shulde be syt vppon in an<br />
hygh feest daye / whan all the comonaltye<br />
after theyr olde custome are gyuen to the<br />
sight of playes / ordeined after a perpetual<br />
vsage for the nones for them / all maters<br />
of the law laid for the tyme vtterly a part.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; He began also an other oracion for one<br />
Sext[us] Roscius / out of the daunger of the<br />
season that he spake in.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; One may besyde these vse other maner<br />
of prohemes / whiche by cause they are nat<br />
set out of the very mater it selfe / or els the<br />
circumstaunces / as in these aforsayd they<br />
are called peregrine or stra&#363;ge prohemes.<br />
And they be taken out of s&#275;tences / sol&#275;pne<br />
peticions / maners or customes / lawes / sta[-]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[B.v.r]</a></span><br />
tutes of nacyons &amp; contreys. And on this<br />
maner dothe Aristides begyn his oracion<br />
made to the praise of Rome.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Demosthenes in his oracyon made a-<br />
gainst Eschines / toke his preface out of a<br />
solempne peticion / besechynge the goddes<br />
that he might haue as good fauour in y<span class="sup">t</span><br />
cause / as he had fo&#363;de in all other maters<br />
y<span class="sup">t</span> he had done afore for the comon welth.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; In like maner beginneth Tully the ora[-]<br />
cion that he made for one Murena / &amp; also<br />
the oracyon that he made vnto the Ro-<br />
maynes after his retourne from exyle.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; He begynneth also an other oracyon /<br />
whiche he made as touchynge a lawe de-<br />
creed for the diuision of feldes amonge the<br />
comunes out of a custome amonge them /<br />
on this wyse.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; The maner and custome of our olde fa-<br />
ders of Rome hath ben. &amp;c. And this is the<br />
maner of prefaces in any oracion / whiche<br />
is also obserued in the making of epistles /<br />
how beit there is farre lesse crafte in them<br />
than is in an oracyon.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; There is yet an other fourme &amp; maner<br />
to begyn by insinuacion / wherfore it beho[-]<br />
ueth to know that insinuacion is / wh&#257; in<br />
the begynnyng / yf the mater seme nat lau[-]<br />
dable or honest / we find an excuse therfore.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[B.v.v]</a></span></p>

<p>
&para; Example / Homere in his Iliade des-<br />
cribeth one Thersites / that he was moost<br />
foule and euyll fauored of all the Grekes<br />
that came to the batayle of Troye / for he<br />
was both gogle eyed / and lame on the one<br />
legge / with croked and pynched shulders /<br />
and a longe pyked hede / balde in very ma-<br />
ny places. And besyde these fautes he was<br />
a great folysshe babler / and ryght foule<br />
mouthed / and ful of debate and stryfe / car-<br />
rynge alwayes agaynste the heddes and<br />
wyse men of the armye.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Nowe if one wolde take vpon hym to<br />
make an oraci&#333; to the prayse of this losel /<br />
whiche mater is of litle honesty in it selfe /<br />
he must vse in stede of a preface an insinu-<br />
acion. That what thynge poetes or com-<br />
mune fame doth eyther prayse or dispraise<br />
ought nat to be gyuen credence to / but ra-<br />
ther to be suspecte. For ones it is the na-<br />
ture of poetes to fayne and lye / as bothe<br />
Homere and Virgile / which are the prin-<br />
ces and heddes of al poetes to witnesse th&#275;<br />
selfe. Of whome Homere sayth / that poe-<br />
tes make many lies / and Virgile he saith:<br />
The moost part of the sene is but deceyte.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[B.vi.r]</a></span><br />
Poetes haue sene blake soules vnder the<br />
erthe / poetes haue fayned and made many<br />
lyes of the pale kyngdome of <a href="#Printer_Errors">Plato</a> / and<br />
of the water of Stigie / and of dogges in<br />
hell. And agayne c&#333;mune rumours howe<br />
often they ben vayne / it is so open that it<br />
nede nat to be declared. Wherfore his trust<br />
is that the hearers wyll more regarde his<br />
saynge than fayned fables of poetes / and<br />
fleyng tales of lyght folkes / whiche ar for<br />
the more parte the grounders of fame &amp;<br />
rumours.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; An example may be fet out of the decla-<br />
macion that Erasmus made to the prayse<br />
of folysshenes.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; An other example hath the same Eras-<br />
mus in his second booke of Copia / which<br />
is this: Plato in the fyfte dialogue of his<br />
communaltie wyllethe that no man shall<br />
haue no wyfe of his owne / but that euery<br />
woman shalbe commune to euery man. If<br />
any man than wolde eyther prayse or de-<br />
fende this mynde of Plato / which is both<br />
contrarie to Christes religion and to the<br />
commune lyuynge of m&#275; / he myght as E-<br />
rasmus teacheth / begynne thus.<br />

<p class="center">
&para; The Narracion or tale wherin p[er]sones<br />
are praysed / is the declaryng of theyr lyfe<br />
&amp; doynges after the fasshion of an historie.<br />
The places out of the whiche it is sought<br />
are: The persones byrthe. His chyldhode.<br />
His adolescencie. His mannes state. His<br />
old age. His dethe and what<br />
foloweth after.<br />
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/capi.png" width="84" height="90" alt="I" title="I" class="floatl" />
N his byrthe is consydered of<br />
what stocke he came / what cha&#363;[-]<br />
sed at the tyme of his natiuite or<br />
nighe vpon / as in the natiuite of<br />
Christe shepeherdes hard angelles synge.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; In his chyldhode are marked his<br />
bryngynge vp and tokens of wysdome c&#333;-<br />
mynge: As Horace in his fourthe Satire<br />
sheweth / how in his chyldhode his father<br />
taught hym by examples of suche as were<br />
than lyuynge to flee from vice and to gyue<br />
hym selfe to vertue.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; In adolescencie is considered where to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[B.viii.r]</a></span><br />
he than gyuethe hym selfe; As in the<br />
fyrst comedie of Ter&#275;ce one Simo telleth<br />
his serua&#363;t Sosia / that though all yonge<br />
men for the more parte gyue them selfe to<br />
some peculiare thynge / wherin they sette<br />
theyr chiefe delyght / as some to haue goo-<br />
dely horses / some to cherysshe houndes for<br />
huntyng / &amp; some are gyuen onely to theyr<br />
bookes / his sone P&#257;philus loued none of<br />
these more one th&#257; an other / and yet in al<br />
these he exercised hym selfe mesurably.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; In mannes state and olde age is noted<br />
what office or rule he bare among his citi-<br />
sens / or in his c&#333;trey / what actes he dyd /<br />
how he gouerned suche as were vnd[er] him /<br />
howe he p[ro]spered / &amp; what fortune he had in<br />
suche thyng[e]s as he went about. Example<br />
here of is in Saluste / whiche c&#333;pareth to[-]<br />
gether Cato and Cesar / sayng that both<br />
theyr stocke / age &amp; eloqu&#275;ce / were almoost<br />
lyke &amp; egall / theyr excell&#275;cie &amp; greatnes of<br />
spirite &amp; wytte was also lyke &amp; egal / &amp; lyke<br />
fame &amp; worshyppe had they both attayned<br />
howe be it nat by a lyke waye. Cesar was<br />
had &#299; great estimacion for his benefites &amp;<br />
<a href="#Printer_Errors">&amp;</a> liberalite. Cato had gott&#275; h&#299; a name for<br />
his p[er]fight &amp; vpright lyuynge. Cesar was<br />
praysed for his gentilnes and pitie. Cato<br />
was honored for his ernestnes and surete.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[B.viii.v]</a></span></p>

<p>
&para; The tother wanne moche bruyt by gy[-]<br />
uynge large gyftes / by helpynge suche as<br />
were in dystresse / and by forgyuyng of tres[-]<br />
passes done agaynste hym. Catons fame<br />
dyd sprede because he wold neither be for-<br />
gyuen of none offence / neither forgiue non<br />
other / but as any man had deserued / so to<br />
cause him to be delt with. In the one was<br />
great refuge to suche as were in mysery:<br />
In the other was sore punisshment &amp; per-<br />
nicion to mysdoers &amp; euyll transgressours<br />
of the law. Briefly to conclude it was all<br />
Ceazars mynde and pleasure to labour di-<br />
ligently night and day in his frendes cau[-]<br />
ses / to care lesse for his owne busynes th&#257;<br />
for theyrs / to deny nothing that was wor[-]<br />
thy to be asked / his desyre was euermore<br />
to be in warre / to haue a great hoost of m&#275;<br />
vnder his gouernaunce / that by his noble<br />
and hardy faictes his valyantnes myght<br />
be the more knowen and spred abrood.</p>

<p>C&#333;traryly all Catons study was on tem[-]<br />
pera&#363;ce / and to do in no maner otherwyse<br />
than was conuenient &amp; fyttynge for suche<br />
a man as he was / and chiefly he sette his<br />
mynde to seueryty / he neuer made no com[-]<br />
parison with the riche man in richesse / nor<br />
with the myghty man in power. But yf<br />
nede required / with the hardy m&#257; in bold-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[C.i.r]</a></span><br />
nes / with the temperate in moderacion /<br />
with the good man in innocency &amp; iust dea[-]<br />
ling. He cared not for the name / it was suf-<br />
fici&#275;t to hym to haue the dede / &amp; so / the lesse<br />
he cared for glorye / the more alwayes he<br />
opteyned. Many suche comparisons ve-<br />
ry profitable for this int&#275;t / are also in Plu[-]<br />
tarche in his boke of noble mennes lyues.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; A goodly ens&#257;ple of this place is in the<br />
oracion that Hermola[us] Barbarus made<br />
to the emperour Frederike and Maximi-<br />
lian his son / which for bicause it is so long<br />
I let it passe. &para; A like ensample is in Tul-<br />
lies oracion / that he made to the people of<br />
Rome for Pompeyus / to be sente agaynst<br />
Mithridates.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Some there be that deuide the <a href="#Printer_Errors">landes</a><br />
of persones into thre kindes of goodes / be-<br />
gynnynge the narracion at them / whiche<br />
thynge our author doth nat greatly com-<br />
mende / but rather in rehersyng of any per[-]<br />
sones dedes / yf there can nat be kept an or-<br />
der of historie / and many thynges must be<br />
spoken. It were after his mynde best to<br />
touche fyrst his actes done by prudence / &amp;<br />
next by iustice / thirdely by fortitude of the<br />
mynde / and last by temperaunce / and so to<br />
gather the narracion out of this foure car-<br />
dinall vertues. As if one shuld praise saint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[C.i.v]</a></span><br />
Austen / after that he hath spoken of his pa[-]<br />
rentele and bryngynge vp in youthe / and<br />
is come to the rehersale of his actes / they<br />
may be conueniently distributed into the<br />
places of vertues. On this maner did Tul[-]<br />
ly prayse Pompey.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; I suppose (sayeth he) that in hym that<br />
shulde be a hed capitayne ouer a great ar-<br />
my / ought to be foure thynges. Knowlege<br />
of werre / valiantnes / auctoritie / &amp; felicitie.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Here is to be noted that in rehersynge<br />
any persons actes / we may haue our chief<br />
respecte to some peculiare and principall<br />
vertue in hym / enlargynge and exaltynge<br />
it by amplificaci&#333; in maner of a digressi&#333;.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Our author in this worke maketh no<br />
mencyon of the last place that is dethe<br />
and suche thynges as folowe after / but in<br />
an other greater work he declareth it thus<br />
briefly. &para; The dethe of the persone hathe<br />
also his praises / as of suche whiche haue<br />
ben slayne for the defence of theyr contrey<br />
or prince.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; A very goodly ensample for the hande-<br />
lynge of this place is in an epistle that An[-]<br />
gele Policiane writeth in his fourth boke<br />
of epistels to Iames Antiquarie of Lau-<br />
rence Medices / howe wysely and deuout-<br />
ly he dysposed hym selfe in his dethe bed /<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[C.ii.r]</a></span><br />
and of his departynge / and what <a href="#Printer_Errors">chann[-]<br />
ced</a> at that tyme.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; And so to conclude an oracion Demon-<br />
stratiue / wherein persones are lauded / is<br />
an historycall exposicion of all his lyfe in<br />
order. And there is no difference betwene<br />
this kynde and an history / saue that in hi-<br />
stories we be more briefe and vse lesse curi-<br />
ositie. Here all thynges be augm&#275;ted and<br />
coloured with as moche ornamentes of<br />
eloquence as can be had.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Confirmacion of our purpose / and con-<br />
futynge or reprouynge of the contrarye /<br />
whiche are the partes of contencion / are<br />
nat requisite in this kynde of oracion / for<br />
here are nat treated any doubtefull ma-<br />
ters / to whome contencion perteineth.</p>

<p>Neuer the lesse / somtyme it happeneth<br />
(how beit it is seldome) that a doubte may<br />
come / which must be either defended / or at<br />
the leest excused.<br />

<span class="dropcaplg">T</span>He frenche men in olde tyme<br />

the Romaynes / and so sore be-<br />
sieged theym that they were by compul-<br />
cion constrayned to fall to composicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[C.ii.v]</a></span><br />
with the frenche men for an huge summe<br />
of golde / to be payed to theym for the bre-<br />
kynge of the siege / but beynge in this ex-<br />
treme misery / they sent for one Camillus /<br />
whome nat very longe afore they had ba-<br />
nisshed out of the citie / and in his absence<br />
made hym dictatour / which was the chie-<br />
fest dignitie amonge the Romaynes / and<br />
of so greate auctoritie / that for the space of<br />
thre monethes / for so long dured the office<br />
moost c&#333;ueniently / he might do all thyng<br />
at his pleasure / whether it concerned deth<br />
or no / nor no m&#257; so hardy ones to say nay<br />
against any thyng that he dyd / so that for<br />
the space he was as a kynge / hauynge all<br />
in his owne mere power. Now it cha&#363;ced<br />
that while this summe was in payenge / &amp;<br />
nat fully wayed / Camillus of whome I<br />
said afore / that being in exile he was made<br />
dictatour / came with an army / and anone<br />
bad cease of the payment / &amp; that eche par-<br />
ty shulde make redy to bataile / and so he<br />
vainquisshed the frenche men.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Now yf one shulde praise hym of his no[-]<br />
ble faites / it shuld seme that this was done<br />
contrary to the law of armes / to defait the<br />
frenche men of the raumsom due to them /<br />
syns the compacte was made afore / wher-<br />
fore it is necessary for the oratour to def&#275;de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[C.iii.r]</a></span><br />
this dede / &amp; to proue that he did nothynge<br />
contrary to equitie. For the whiche pur-<br />
pose he hathe two places. One apparent /<br />
whiche is a comon sayenge vsurped of the<br />
poete. <i>Dolus <a href="#Printer_Errors">au</a> virtus quis in hoste requirat.</i><br />
That is to say / who will serche whether y<span class="sup">e</span><br />
dede of enemy against enemy be either gile<br />
or pure valiantnes? But for that in warre<br />
law is as well to be kept as in other thin-<br />
ges. This sayeng is but of a feble gro&#363;de.<br />
The other is of a more stronge assura&#363;ce /<br />
whiche Titus Liuius writeth in his fyfte<br />
boke from the buildynge of Rome / where<br />
he reherceth this history now mencioned /<br />
and that answere is this / that the c&#333;pacte<br />
was made to paye the foresayd raunsome<br />
after that Camillus was created dicta-<br />
tour / at what time it was nat lawfull that<br />
they whiche were of ferre lesse auctoritie /<br />
ye &amp; had put them selfe holy in his hande /<br />
shuld entermedle them with any maner of<br />
treatise without his licence / &amp; that he was<br />
nat bounde to stande to theyr bargayne.<br />
The whiche argumente is deducte out of<br />
two circumstaunces / whereof one is the<br />
tyme of the makynge of the compacte / and<br />
the other / the persons that made it / which<br />
two circumstaunces may briefly be called<br />
whan / and who. &para; Likewise yf an oracion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[C.iii.v]</a></span><br />
shulde be made to the laude of saint Pe-<br />
ter / it behoueth to excuse his denyenge of<br />
christe / that it was rather of diuine power<br />
and wyll: than otherwise / for a confortable<br />
example to synners of grace yf they rep&#275;t.<br />

his vertues in warre / and of other agre-<br />
ynge with peace / in the whiche (as his hi-<br />

peace / and agayne he was so gentyll and<br />
so mercyfull / that he wolde rather saue<br />
euyn suche as had don hym great offence:<br />
and had deserued very well for to dye / th&#257;<br />
to dystroye theym / thoughe he might do it<br />
conueniently.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Besyde this / he was so greatly enfla-<br />
med in the loue of god and his holy chirch /<br />
that one Alcuine a noble clerk of England<br />
was continually with hym / in whose prea[-]<br />

<p>

you may be sure he wold neuer haue done /<br />
saue onely that he had fully determined to<br />

his malicius ent&#275;t afore Miloes comyng.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; In this pece of Tullies narracion are<br />
entermengled fyrst that Clodius knew of<br />

Clodius met Milo / whiche also gyueth a<br />
great suspicion / for it was nygh Clodius<br />

the tother was in leest assura&#363;ce. Thyrdly<br />
that he departed out of the city / what tyme<br />

purpose / and what other shulde it seme th&#257;<br />

<p class="center">&para; The proposicion.</p>

<p>
<span class="dropcaplg">O</span>Ut of the narracion must be ga-<br />
deryd a briefe sentence / wherein<br />
shall stande the hole pithe of the<br />
cause / for Rhetoriciens put incontinent af[-]<br />
ter the narracion diuision / which is a part<br />
of contencion / &amp; dothe bryefly shew wherin<br />
the controuersy doth stande / or what thin-<br />
ges shall be spoken of in the oracion. This<br />
diuision is deuyded into seiunction and di-<br />
stribucion.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Seiunction is whan we shew wherein<br />
our aduersaries and we agree / and what it<br />
is / whereupon we stryue. As they that ple-<br />
dyd Clodius cause agaynst Milo / myght<br />
on this maner haue vsed seiunction. That<br />
Milo slew Clodius: our aduersaries can<br />
nat denaye / but whether he myght so do<br />
lawfully or nat / is our controuersy. Distri-<br />
bucion is the proposicion wherein we de-<br />
clare of what thynges we wyll speke / of<br />
whiche yf we propose how many they be /<br />
it is called enumeracion / but yf we do nat<br />
expresse the nombre / it is called exposicion.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Example of bothe is had in the oracion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[E.i.v]</a></span><br />
that Tully made to the people that Pom-<br />
peyus myght be made chiefe capitayne of<br />

<p>
<span class="dropcap">F</span>yrste, I thynke it expedyent to speke<br />

and after that of the greatnes thereof / and<br />
than to shewe how an hede or chiefe capy-<br />
tayne of any army shulde be chosen.<br />
</p>

<p>
Whiche last membre of his exposicion he a-<br />
gayne distributeth into foure partes thus<br />
as foloweth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dropcap">T</span>Ruely this is myne opinion / that he<br />
whiche shall be a gouernour of an<br />
hoost / ought to haue these foure property-<br />
es in hym. The fyrste is / that he haue per-<br />
fyte knowlege of all suche thynges as lon-<br />
geth to warre. The seconde is that he be a<br />
man of his handes. The thyrde that he be<br />
a man of suche auctority: that his dignity<br />
may cause his souldiers to haue hym in re-<br />
uerence and awe. The fourth is that he be<br />
fortunate and lucky in all thynges that he<br />
goeth about.<br />

that in introductions men must labour to<br />

what shall make for his purpose / &amp; how to<br />
set it furthe. And therfore this shall suffyse<br />
as touchynge the qualitie of the person.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; If we bere away this for a generall rule<br />
(that what maketh for the accuser euer-<br />
more the contrary) is sure staye for the de-<br />
fender / yf he can proue it / or make it of the<br />
more lykelyhood. As Tully in defendynge<br />
Milo / layeth to Clodius frendes charges<br />
that he had non about hym but chos&#275; m&#275;.<br />
And for to clere Milo he sheweth the con-<br />
trary / that he had with hym syngyng lad-<br />
des and women seruantes that wayted on<br />
his wyfe / whiche maketh it of more likely-<br />
hood y<span class="sup">t</span> Clodius went about to slee Milo:<br />
than Mylo hym.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; The cause that moueth to the mischiefe<br />
lyeth in two thynges. In naturall impul-<br />
sion / and racionacion.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Natural impulsion is angre / hatred / co[-]<br />
uetyse / loue / or suche other affections.<br />
</p>

<p>
So Simo in Therence / whan he had sayd<br />
that Dauus (wh&#333; he had poynted to wayt<br />
vppon his sone Pamphilus) wolde do all<br />
that myght lye in hym bothe with hande<br />
and fote / rather to dysplease hym: than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[E.v.r]</a></span><br />
please Pamphilus mynde. And Sosia de-<br />
maunded why he wolde do so. Simo made<br />
aunswere by raciocinacion / sayenge / doest<br />
thou aske that? mary his vngracious and<br />
vnhappy mynde is the cause therof.<br />
</p>

<p>
Oenon in Ouides epistles ioyneth to gy-<br />
ther qualitie and naturall impulsion / say-<br />
enge. <i>A iuuene et Cupido credatur reddita vir-<br />
go?</i> whiche is in Englysshe. Thynke you<br />
that she that was caried awaye of a yonge<br />
man / and hote in loue / was restored agayn<br />
a mayde?<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Tulli in the oracion for Milo / amonge<br />
other argum&#275;tes bryngeth in one against<br />
Clodius by naturall impulsion of hatred /<br />
shewynge that Clodius had cause to hate<br />
Milo fyrst / for he was one of them that la[-]<br />
boured for the same Tullyes reuocacyon<br />
from exyle / whiche Tulli Clodius malici-<br />
ously hated. Agayne that Milo oppressyd<br />
many of his furiouse purposes. And final-<br />
ly by cause the sayd Milo accused hym and<br />
cast hym afore the Senate and people of<br />
Rome. <img src="images/leaf2.png" width="43" height="24" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
&para; Raciocinaci&#333; is that cometh of hope of<br />
any commodity / or to eschew any discom-<br />
modity. As Tully argueth in his oracion<br />
for Milo agaynst Clodius by raciocinaci-<br />
on to proue that it was he that layde wayt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[E.v.v]</a></span><br />
for Milo on this maner.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="dropcap">I</span>T is sufficient to proue that this cru-<br />
ell and wicked beest had a great cause<br />
to slee Milo / yf he wolde brynge his ma-<br />
ters that he w&#275;t about to passe / and great<br />
hope if he were ones gone / nat to be letted<br />
in his pretenced malyce.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; After raciocinacion foloweth compro-<br />

dayes to an ende. And that he went out of<br />
the city a lytle afore Milo rode furth with<br />
a great companye of stronge and mysche-<br />
uous knaues.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Signes folowynge are as yf after the<br />

long to the defender / saue that in signes he<br />
must vse .ii. thinges / absolucion &amp; inuerci&#333;.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Absoluci&#333; is wherby the defendour she-<br />
weth that it is laufull for hym to do that<br />
what the aduersary bringeth in for a signe<br />

<p>
&para; State negociall absolute is whan the<br />
thynge that is in controuersy is absolute-<br />
ly defended to be laufully done. As in the<br />
oraci&#333; of Tulli for Milo / the dede is styfly<br />
affirmed to be lawfully done in sleyng Clo[-]<br />

ty or reason / iugem&#275;t / necessity / bargayne<br />
or couenant. &para; Of the whiche places Tul[-]<br />

that euery creature shuld defende hym selfe<br />

</p>

<p>
&para; State assumptiue is whan the defence<br />
is feble of it selfe / but yet it may be holpen<br />
by some other thynge added to it. And the<br />
places longynge to this state are graun-<br />
tynge of the faute / remouynge of the faut /<br />
or (as we say in our tongue) layeng it from<br />
vs to an other / &amp; <a href="#Printer_Errors">tanslatynge</a> of the faute.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Grauntyng of the faut is whan the per[-]<br />
son accused denieth nat the dede / but yet he<br />
desyreth to be forgyuen / &amp; it hath .ii. places<br />
mo annexyd to it / purgacion &amp; deprecaci&#333;.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Purgacion is whan he sayeth he dyd it<br />
nat maliciously: but by ignor&#257;ce or mishap<br />
whiche place Cato vseth ironiously in Sa[-]<br />
lust / thus. My minde is that ye haue pyty<br />
with you / for they that haue don amysse be<br />

but we call vpon the Iustices mercy. The<br />

prayse / that he may by these meanes seme<br />
rather worthy to be auaunced in honour<br />
for his good qualities / than to be punished<br />
for his fall.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; This done / let hym reherce some other<br />

this is. It shall also greatly auayle yf he<br />
can shewe that he hathe in tyme afore ben<br />
in auctoritie and bare a rule ouer other / in<br />

his punysshment. And finally than by co-<br />

<p class="center">&para; Example of the fyrst.</p>

<p>
<span class="dropcap">M</span>En say it is a law in Caleys that no<br />
straunger may go vppon the towne<br />
walles on payne of dethe. Now than pose<br />
that in tyme of warre the towne beynge<br />
harde besieged / an alien dwellynge in the<br />
towne getteth hym to the walles amonge<br />
the soudiers / &amp; doeth more good than any<br />
one man agayn. Now after the siege ended<br />
he is accused for transgressyng of the law /<br />
which in wordes is euidently against him.<br />
But here the defendaunt must declare the<br />
wryters mynde by circumstaunces / what<br />
straunger he dyd forbyd / and what tyme /<br />
and after what maner / and in what intent<br />
he wolde nat haue any straunger to come<br />
on the walles / &amp; in what intent his mynde<br />
might be vnderstanden to suffre an alien to<br />
go vpon the walles. And here must the ef-<br />
fect of the stra&#363;gers wyll be declared / that<br />
he went vp to defend y<span class="sup">e</span> towne to put back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[F.iiii.r]</a></span><br />
their enemies. And therto he must say that<br />
the maker was nat so vndiscrete &amp; vnreaso[-]<br />
nable that he wolde haue no maner of ex-<br />
cepcion which shuld be to the welth / p[ro]fite /<br />
or preseruacion of the towne. For he that<br />
wyll nat haue y<span class="sup">e</span> law to be vnderstand&#275; ac[-]<br />
cordyng to equitie / good maner / &amp; nature /<br />
entendeth to proue the maker therof either<br />
an vniust man / or folyssh or enuiouse.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; The accuser contraryly shall praise the<br />
maker of the law for his great wisdom / for<br />
his playne writyng without any maner of<br />
ambiguity / y<span class="sup">t</span> no stra&#363;ger shulde p[re]sume to<br />
go vpon the walles / &amp; reherce y<span class="sup">e</span> law word<br />
for worde / &amp; th&#257; shew som reasonable cause<br />
that mouyd the maker of the law that he<br />
wolde vtterly that no straunger shulde as-<br />
cende the walles. &amp;c. Ex&#257;ple of the sec&#333;d.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="dropcap">A</span> Man in his testam&#275;t gyueth to two<br />
yonge doughters that he hathe two<br />
h&#363;dred shepe / to be delyuered at the day of<br />
theyr maryage / on this maner. <img src="images/hand.png" width="37" height="23" alt="hand" title="hand" /> I wyll<br />
that myne executoures shall gyue to my<br />
doughters at the tyme of theyr maryage<br />
euery of theym an hundred shepe / suche as<br />
they wyll. At the tyme of maryage they de[-]<br />
maunde theyr cattell / whiche the execu-<br />
tours deliuer nat of suche sort as the may-<br />
d&#275;s wold / wherup&#333; the c&#333;trouersy ariseth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[F.iiii.v]</a></span><br />
For the executours say they are bounde to<br />
delyuer to euery of them an hundred shepe /<br />
suche as they that be the executours will.<br />
Now here standeth the dout / to whom we<br />
shall referre this worde <i>they</i> / to the dought-<br />
ters / or to the executours.<br />
</p>

<p>
The maydens say nay thereto / but that it<br />
was theyr fathers mynde that they shulde<br />
haue euery of theym an .C. shepe / suche as<br />
they that be the doughters wyll.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; The handelyng of doutfull wrytyng is<br />
to shew yf it be possible that it is nat wryt&#275;<br />
doutfully by cause it is the comon maner to<br />
take it after as we saye / &amp; that it may sone<br />
be knowen by suche wordes as partely go<br />
before that clause &amp; p[ar]tly folow / &amp; that there<br />
be few wordes / but if they be considered so<br />
alone / they may anon be taken doubtfully.<br />
And first we shal shew if we can y<span class="sup">t</span> it is nat<br />
doubtfully wryten / for there is no reasona[-]<br />
ble m&#257;: but he wyll take it as we say. Th&#257;<br />
shal we declare by that that goeth afore / &amp;<br />
foloweth / that it is clerly euin as we say / &amp;<br />
that yf we consider the wordes of th&#275; selfe<br />
they wyll seme to be of ambiguity / but se-<br />
ynge they may by the rest of the wrytynge<br />
be euident ynough / they ought nat to be ta[-]<br />
ken as doubtfull. And than shew that yf it<br />
had ben his minde that made the writyng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[F.v.r]</a></span><br />
to haue it taken as the aduersarye sayeth:<br />
he neded nat to haue wryt&#275; any suche wor[-]<br />
des. As in the example now put / the may-<br />
dens may say that yf it had ben theyr fa-<br />
thers mynde that the executours shoulde<br />
haue delyuered suche shepe as it had plea-<br />
sed them to delyuer: he neded nat to haue<br />
added these wordes <i>suche as they wyll</i>. For<br />
yf they had nat ben put / it wolde nat haue<br />
ben dought but that the executours dely-<br />
uerynge euery of them an hundred shepe<br />
(what so euer they were) had fulfylled the<br />
wyll / and coulde haue ben no further com-<br />
pelled / wherfore if his mynde was as they<br />
say / it was a great folye to put in tho wor-<br />
des whiche made a playne mater to be vn-<br />
plaine. And than finally shew it is more ho[-]<br />
nest and conuenient to expounde it as we<br />
say: than as our aduersaries do.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; Raciocinacion is whan the mater is in<br />
controuersy / wherupon no law is decreed /<br />
but yet the iugement therof may be fo&#363;de<br />
out by lawes made vpon maters somdele<br />
resemblynge thereunto.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; As in Rome was this law made / that<br />
yf any persone were distraught / his posses-<br />
sions and goodes shulde come to the han-<br />
des of his next kynne.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; And an other law / what any househol-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[F.v.v]</a></span><br />
der doth ordeyn &amp; make as concernyng his<br />
householde and other goodes / it is appro-<br />
bate and confirmed by the law.<br />
</p>

<p>
&para; And an other law / if any housholder dye<br />
intestate / his money &amp; other goodes shal re[-]<br />
mayne to his next kyn. &para; It cha&#363;ced one<br />
to kyll his owne mother / wherup&#333; he was<br />
taken &amp; c&#333;d&#275;pned to deth / but while he lay<br />
in pryson / certayn of his familiare frendes<br />
cam thyder to hym / &amp; brought with them<br />
a clerke to wryte his testament / whiche he<br />
there made / &amp; made suche executours as it<br />
pleased hym. After his deth his kynnesm&#275;<br />
chalenge his good[e]s / his executours say th&#275;<br />
nay / wherup&#333; ariseth c&#333;trouersy afore the<br />
iustice. &para; There is no law made vpon this<br />
case / whether he y<span class="sup">t</span> hath killed his mother<br />
may make any testam&#275;t or nat / but it may<br />
be reasoned on bothe p[ar]ties by the lawes a-<br />
boue reherced. The kynsmen shal allege y<span class="sup">e</span><br />
law made for th&#275; y<span class="sup">t</span> be out of theyr mynd[e]s /<br />
p[re]supposyng hym nat to be in moche other<br />
case / or els he wold nat haue don the dede.<br />
The contrary parte shall allege the other<br />
law / &amp; shew that it was none alienacion of<br />
mynde: but som other cause y<span class="sup">t</span> moued hym<br />
to it / &amp; that he hathe had his punysshment<br />
therfore / whiche he shulde nat haue suffred<br />
of c&#333;uenient if he had ben besyde him selfe.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[F.vi.r]</a></span></p>

<p>
&para; Translacion is whiche the lawyers call<br />
excepcion / as yf the person accused pleade<br />
that it is nat lawfull for the tother to ac-<br />
cuse hym / or that the Iuge can be no iuge<br />
in that cause. &amp;c.<br />
